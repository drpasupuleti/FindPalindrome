**Find A Palindrome**

How it works:

Step # 1: Place a text file under sr/main/resources

Step #2 : Run the `FindPalindrome` program to find if the file contains a palindrome.

Business Logic:

First, the program cleans out the text. Meaning, all the punctionations and whitespaces will be removed. 
The final String will now be read character-by-character and compare with the reversed string.
