Find A Palindrome

How it works:

Step # 1: Provide a page path to the the service created as a request body(text/plain): localhost:8080/findPalindrome

Step #2 : Then, It returns a valid message.

Business Logic:

First, the program cleans out the text. Meaning, all the punctuations and whitespaces will be removed.
The final String will now be read character-by-character and compare with the reversed string.
